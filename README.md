# Flood Susceptibility Mapping using GIS-based AHP Modeling- https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rines.2025.100079

## Project Overview
This repository documents the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) used to identify flood-prone zones in the Kali River Basin (Southwest India). This research was critical following the unprecedented 2019 flood events in the region.

## Technical Methodology
I utilized the **Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)** to integrate 8 thematic layers. The model was validated using the **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)** curve, achieving an **AUC of 0.887 (88.7%)**.



### Key Layers & Factors:
* **Topography:** Elevation and Slope (derived from SRTM DEM).
* **Hydrology:** Distance from River, Drainage Density, and Rainfall.
* **Surface:** LULC (Land Use/Land Cover), Soil Texture, and Geology.

## Tools & Software
* **GIS Platform:** ArcGIS Pro / QGIS.
* **Techniques:** Weighted Overlay Analysis, Pairwise Comparison Matrix (Saaty’s Scale), Accuracy Assessment.
